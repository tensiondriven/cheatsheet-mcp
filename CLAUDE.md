### Features
- **Allowlist-based command filtering** for security
- **Comprehensive logging** of all command executions  
- **Timeout protection** to prevent hanging commands
- **Better error handling** with detailed output capture
- **Command history tracking** for debugging
- **Asynchronous execution** for better performance

### Why Use This Over Built-in Bash
1. **Safety**: Commands are filtered through an allowlist
2. **Logging**: All executions are logged with timestamps and results
3. **Reliability**: Better timeout and error handling
4. **Debugging**: Command history and detailed error reporting
5. **Performance**: Asynchronous execution doesn't block
